## Mini-Conf

<a href="https://mini-conf.github.io/index.html">MiniConf</a> is a virtual conference in a box. It is designed to:

* Run based on static files hosted by any server. 
* Be modifiable without a database using CSV files.
* Easy to extend to fit any backend or additional frontend tools. 

To get started just `pip install -r requirements.txt` and run `./run.sh `. When you are ready to deploy run
`./freeze.sh` to get a static version of the site.
